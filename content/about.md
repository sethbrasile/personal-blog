To some extent, this is just my ([Seth Brasile](/authors/seth-brasile)) personal blog. I write about software development, programming languages, and computer science. I also write about things that generally interest me such as general technology, science, music production, and making stuff.

Sometimes some of my friends will write guest posts. I'm interested in new contributors, so if you're interested in writing a guest post, please reach out to me.
