I'm a software engineer and an IT professional. I'm passionate about open source software, privacy, and the web. I'm currently trying to finally get around to
creating youtube and blog content because I believe I have knowledge on some topics that could be useful to others.

I have spent about 50% of my time developing with web technologies and managing web infrastructure and the other 50% working on IT infrastructure, automation, and cybersecurity.

IT people could really learn a lot from web people, and one of my life's goals is to bridge that gap. I believe that web technology is the future of IT.

I don't expect to write super often, but here and there I'll post some content that I think is useful.
