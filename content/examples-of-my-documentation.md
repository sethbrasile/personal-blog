YouTube + Home Automation
---

This project includes a few youtube videos which show you how to trigger home automations using children's magic wands:

Blog Content
---

This is an article from this blog. I recommend checking out part 2, because in part 1, I allowed Github copilot assist me in creating the article outline and
headings and some of the content as well. For parts 2 and 3, I didn't appreciate github copilot's "voice" so I turned it off and wrote without AI assistance.

Ember Audio
---

This is an older open source project that I wrote. The documentation is quite thorough so even though it is quite old, I believe it is a solid public example of
my work. I recommend checking out the "synthesis" and "timing" sections for more advanced examples.

Please also check out the yuidoc api docs for the same project:

Remember, this was before Typescript was in general use, so API documentation like this for a JS project was really helpful at this time.


EZ Web Audio
---

Here, I have started porting ember-audio to be framework-agnostic and written in typescript.

I have not finished this project because life happens!
