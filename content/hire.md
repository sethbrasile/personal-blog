## What I do

### Web sites and web apps, design, build, host, manage

I do web consulting and build/host/maintain web sites and apps with my company [Tenor Creative.](https://tenorcreative.com) I have assembled a very
experienced and talented team over there, and if you need a web project or a web app built, I hope you'll contact us.

I have consulted for and built many successful web apps and SaaS systems. My most recent was a "mastermind" platform called BetterLife
by real estate guy Brandon Turner. I (and the team I put together) built their entire offering from the ground up during their startup phase. You can read more about that [here.](/cv)

My team is incredibly capable, so for a free consultation:

### IT

I have spent many of my years working in IT and in enterprise, including 2 years as a Centralized Services Automation Specialist, writing powershell, managing RMM + all MSP tooling, and handling cyber security for a successful medium sized MSP.

### General Tech, IoT, hardware, etc..

Do you need a general tech-obsessed and experienced business-focused nerd to help you with some tech problems that you're not even sure how to think about? I do IoT stuff and hardware, I do web stuff, I do software, I do electronics, I even build stuff out of wood like guitars. Send me a message and I can help you think outside of your box.

### eCommerce

Do you need help automating processes for your eCommerce venture? I do that. I can find you the simplest way to remove human labor from your processes.

For instance, I recently built an eCommerce client a desktop application that scans manufacturer sites given a list of product IDs and turns that into a shopify import.

### Systems Automation

Do you need help automating processes in your business, in general? I do that too. Please get in contact with me!
