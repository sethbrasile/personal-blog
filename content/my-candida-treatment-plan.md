After a ridiculous amount of research on Candida Overgrowth, I came up with this treatment plan.
I made this list just for a few friends, but if you happen to find your way here, I hope it helps you too.
I'm not a doctor, and this is not medical advice. This is just what I'm doing and what I've found works for me.

I may end up writing a more detailed post about my experience with this later, but for now, here is the list of things I'm taking and
a summary of the diet I'm on to help with the treatment.

Note that **THIS IS NOT _THE CANDIDA DIET_**.
That diet is total BS for most people?!

## Supplements

### Antifungals and Biofilm Disruptors:

Note: The Amazon links are affiliate links!! Please use them if you want to support me. I will get a small commission if you buy through these links.

- https://amzn.to/4iFibGI - blend of biofilm disrupting enzymes. This is the most important thing!
- https://amzn.to/4jSTLuf - blend of effective herbal anti-fungals
- https://amzn.to/4jXxITb - probiotic yeast that targets and kills candida without taking up residence (you can take this the whole time or you can wait until later after the biofilms are busted, I'm taking it the whole time but cycling on an off when I feel like it)
- https://amzn.to/438c2OA - needed for the white tongue folks and also helpful for the gut folks, milder than the pills, for when you need a break from the detox
- https://www.apohealth.de/en/collections/all/products/nystatin-acis-filmtabletten-100-st-tabletten - This is the prescription antifungal stuff from germany. This works as a team with the “candassist” and the s. boullardi to kill the bad guys but leave the good guys alone
  - Note for my friend Anni: I actually wish I would have ordered 2 or 3 bottles of this. You end up taking 4 per day so 100 goes pretty quickly. If you want to grab an extra bottle of this I'll buy it from you later.
  - There's probably some legal nonsense I should cover here about not buying this if you live in a place where freedom reigns and therefore it's against the law to access medicine you need.


### Support (these are important too!):

- https://amzn.to/4lMAFrn - anti-fungal and anti-inflammation - has to be taken away from caffeine, at least 3 hours
- https://amzn.to/3GqH7nZ - or any binder if you have a preference, I hear good things about zeolite. I'm using just activated charcoal b/c I failed to order this
- https://amzn.to/3YRolw4 - gut healing amino acid - take in the morning on an empty stomach
- https://amzn.to/42DQ0Dm - gut healing amino acid - take in the morning on an empty stomach
- https://amzn.to/4lP1Wtc - or your choice of electrolytes if you already have some. If you're educated in fasting you probably already have this under control. You will likely be into and out of ketosis during this time which requires a lot of water and electrolytes going back and forth.
- https://amzn.to/4lQuaUn - liver support - important b/c you end up detoxing hard and end up feeling sick, hard on your liver

## Taking breaks

If you do have a bad overgrowth, you will likely exerience heavy "die off" which is basically like an amplified version of whatever
symptoms you usually get when you overdo it on sugar or carbs. This is a sign that the treatment is working, but it can be pretty rough.

I recommend taking breaks from the treatment every 2-3 weeks for a few days. This will help you avoid the worst die-off symptoms and give your body a chance to recover.
Listen to your body. If you're feeling absolutely terrible, take some time off. If you're feeling good, keep going. If you're feeling like HORRIBLE, I have even taken a week
off completely and even ate (moderate) carbs/desserts/pizza for a week and then went back to the treatment. I think this is fine as long as you don't go crazy with it.

You won't be "undoing" your progress. This is a _balance_ thing and it took you likely many many years to get to this point, so don't expect to fix it in a few weeks,
and also don't feel like the progress you've made can be undone in a weekend. That's not how this works.

## Diet

The diet I'm on is a low-carb, low-sugar, high-protein, high-fat diet.

The most important point is that carbs should be on the lower side but not zero, and should come from vegetables.

- NO grains!
- NOTHING sweet (except berries are fine in moderation)
- NO sugar (including honey, maple syrup, etc.)
- NO starchy vegetables (potatoes, corn, etc.)
- Beans are fine in moderation and eaten along with protein and fat
- NO milk (milk and soft cheese have too much sugar - butter, hard cheese (cheddar, meunster, and harder), and heavy cream are fine)
- NO alcohol (alcohol is metabolized by candida!)
- NO artificial sweeteners except stevia and monk fruit and allulose (sugar alcohols feed candida!)
  - Watch out for stevia and monk fruit 1:1 sweeteners, they often have sugar alcohols as a main ingredient

I eat a lot of meat, eggs, and cheese. I also eat some vegetables, but I avoid starchy ones like potatoes and corn. I drink a lot of water and some green/black tea. People say to avoid coffee, but I think people just get hard on withholding things that people enjoy.
I try to keep processed meats to a minimum but I will eat a stray piece of pepperoni or salami. I make milk kefir and drink that daily with a bit of stevia and black berries blended in. I try to eat sauerkraut and kimchi as often as I can, a little with each meal, when I have some handy.

If you go full keto, you will experience a temporary relief of candida overgrowth symptoms, but the candida will adapt to metabolizing ketones and you will have done nothing to control the overgrowth

If you go full carnivore, you might experience candida die off symptoms just like on this treatment plan, but again, the candida will adapt to metabolizing ketones and you will have done nothing to control the overgrowth.

## Timing

I don't know for sure yet how long this is going to take. I expect it to take 6-12 months because I believe I've had biofilms building
in my digestive system since I was a child. I will post back when my symptoms start letting up and I'll likely curate this into a more formal post and journal.
