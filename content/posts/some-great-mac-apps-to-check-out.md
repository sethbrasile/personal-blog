Hey there! I've compiled a list of handy MacOS apps that I started using recently, find very helpful, and might make your life a bit easier:

**[Swish](https://highlyopinionated.co/swish/)**: This is a window manager that uses gestures to control your windows and apps. It's pretty nifty if you're using a trackpad, with about 30 different gestures for moving, resizing, and organizing windows. Not sure how useful it'd be with just a mouse though, I haven't tried it.

**[Shottr](https://shottr.cc/)**: A lightweight screenshot tool that packs a punch. It's tiny (only about 2MB) and super fast. You can do scrolling screenshots, add annotations, and even has text recognition (OCR) capabilities. Pretty cool for something that's free.

**[Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/)**: This one's a powerful alternative to Spotlight. It does everything Spotlight does, plus a bunch more like clipboard history, snippets, and even has an extension store for more features. If you're looking to supercharge your app launcher, this might be worth checking out.

**[Lunar](https://lunar.fyi/)**: If you're using external monitors, Lunar could be really useful. It gives you more control over your external display brightness, and can even sync it with your built-in display. It's got some neat features like dimming below 0% for late-night work.

**[Clop](https://lowtechguys.com/clop/)**: A super handy Mac app that automatically compresses screenshots, images, videos, and PDFs. It's basically a Swiss Army knife for file optimization. Here's what makes it cool:

- **Instant Compression**: Automatically shrinks files when you copy them, with options to compress screenshots, images, and videos
- **Flexible Compression Methods**: You can use a keyboard shortcut (Ctrl + Shift + C) to compress files on demand
- **Drop Zone Feature**: Drag files into a special zone on your screen to compress them quickly
- **Extra Perks**: Can remove EXIF metadata from photos and strip audio from videos
- **Customization**: Lets you set rules for compressing files in specific folders

The app is particularly great for content creators who need to manage file sizes without losing too much quality. It works well with other screenshot tools like CleanShot X and can reduce screen recordings to as little as 1/10th of their original size.

Pricing is pretty reasonable - $15 as a one-time purchase with a 14-day trial, or available through SetApp for those who subscribe to that service. It's designed to be lightweight, fast, and incredibly useful for anyone looking to optimize their Mac's file management or avoid sharing massive files in slack.

I have found these apps very useful, hopefully the recommendations brighten your day!
