      <description>To some extent, this is just my (Seth Brasile) personal blog. I write about software development, programming languages, and computer science. I also write about things that generally interest me such as general technology, science, music production, and making stuff.
Sometimes some of my friends will write guest posts. I&amp;rsquo;m interested in new contributors, so if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in writing a guest post, please reach out to me.</description>

      <title>Protect Your Services with an Immutable Reverse Proxy, Fail2Ban, and Cloudflare (Part 1)</title>

      <description>If you want to skip the intro and disclaimers and get right to the meat of part 1, you can skip to that here.
If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for the tl;dr step-by-step guide, you can skip to part 2 here (but I highly recommend reading through this post first to understand the concepts and theory behind the tools we&amp;rsquo;ll be using).
If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a guide on how to set up an enterprise-grade firewall with pfSense, you can skip to part 3 here.</description>

      <description>If you missed part 1, I highly recommend reading through it first to understand the concepts and theory behind the tools we&amp;rsquo;ll be using. You can jump back to part 1 here.
Step-by-Step Guide Prerequisites Free Cloudflare account Public IP address Domain name Hopefully from Cloudflare.. It will make your life easier but it&amp;rsquo;s not necessary, you can use any domain registrar as long as you change your nameservers to Cloudflare.</description>

      <description>If you missed part 1, I highly recommend reading through it first to understand the concepts and theory behind the tools we&amp;rsquo;ll be using, and this part doesn&amp;rsquo;t make a lot of sense without part 2. Jump back to part 1 or part 2.
Bonus Topic: Setting up an enterprise-grade firewall with pfSense I won&amp;rsquo;t be going into too much detail here, there is loads of information about this already on the internet, but I wanted to give you a brief overview of how to set up a pfSense firewall, and provide some resources to get you started.</description>

      <title>Powershell Code Delivery</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/powershell-code-delivery/</link>

      <description>In todays blog we&amp;rsquo;re going to dive into the realm of delivering and managing Powershell code. The IT sector has often overlooked the standards for code management and delivery that the developer community has established, opting instead for outdated methodologies. These practices are not only challenging to manage, but also prove ineffective in most modern situations. Worse, these methods leave room for exploit via local code storage. We&amp;rsquo;re going to get into what some of those antiquated methods look like that you may be using, why they&amp;rsquo;re &amp;ldquo;bad&amp;rdquo;, then present scalable and easier to manage solutions, and talk through how to implement these practices in your organization.</description>

      <title>Fix a Homepod Mini That Wont Turn On</title>

      <description>I recently faced 3 broken homepod minis, all bought at different times (so different ages), all with the same problem: they would not turn on.
I tried everything I could find online, and nothing worked. I was about to give up and throw them away, but just as I was carrying the first to the trash can, I decided to try one more thing that I&amp;rsquo;ve seen generally work for various electronic devices (like laptops), but not suggested anywhere for these.</description>

      <title>Fixing Throw in Powershell</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/fixing-throw-in-powershell/</link>

      <description>This is going to be a short post because I&amp;rsquo;m only reiterating what another blogger has already written. I&amp;rsquo;m reiterating here because more people should understand this.
If you&amp;rsquo;ve written any amount of powershell, you probably know that Throw does not behave the way that one would expect. James&amp;rsquo; post has finally clarified something that has gotten me many times, and I always figured out a way around it, but never understood exactly what was happening.</description>

      <title>Avoiding Escape Hell in Powershell</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve got a question for you: When working on efficiently managing consistency and security across any more than a small handful of Windows machines, how often do you end your day feeling like you&amp;rsquo;ve been dragged through the very bowels of hell?
As an IT professional working daily on writing scalable powershell code, one of the most painful parts of the job is developing code that switches context. For example, if you&amp;rsquo;re writing a powershell script that needs to be passed into a powershell session through CMD for one reason or another.</description>
