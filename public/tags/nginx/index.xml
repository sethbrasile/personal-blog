      <description>If you want to skip the intro and disclaimers and get right to the meat of part 1, you can skip to that here.
If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for the tl;dr step-by-step guide, you can skip to part 2 here (but I highly recommend reading through this post first to understand the concepts and theory behind the tools we&amp;rsquo;ll be using).
If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a guide on how to set up an enterprise-grade firewall with pfSense, you can skip to part 3 here.</description>

      <description>If you missed part 1, I highly recommend reading through it first to understand the concepts and theory behind the tools we&amp;rsquo;ll be using. You can jump back to part 1 here.
Step-by-Step Guide Prerequisites Free Cloudflare account Public IP address Domain name Hopefully from Cloudflare.. It will make your life easier but it&amp;rsquo;s not necessary, you can use any domain registrar as long as you change your nameservers to Cloudflare.</description>

      <description>If you missed part 1, I highly recommend reading through it first to understand the concepts and theory behind the tools we&amp;rsquo;ll be using, and this part doesn&amp;rsquo;t make a lot of sense without part 2. Jump back to part 1 or part 2.
Bonus Topic: Setting up an enterprise-grade firewall with pfSense I won&amp;rsquo;t be going into too much detail here, there is loads of information about this already on the internet, but I wanted to give you a brief overview of how to set up a pfSense firewall, and provide some resources to get you started.</description>
