      <description>I recently faced 3 broken homepod minis, all bought at different times (so different ages), all with the same problem: they would not turn on.

I was about to give up and throw them away, but just as I was carrying the first to the trash can, I decided to try one more thing that I&amp;rsquo;ve seen generally work for various electronic devices (like laptops), but not suggested anywhere for these.</description>
